WhatsApp just announced their integration of the Signal protocol (formerly known as the Axolotl protocol). An interesting aspect of it is the use of a TLS-like protocol called **Noise Pipes**. A protocol based on the Noise protocol framework, a one-man work led by **Trevor Perrin** with only a few implementations and [a moderately long specificiations available here](http://noiseprotocol.org/). I thought it would be interesting to understand how protocols are made from this framework, and to condense it in a 25 minutes video. Here it is.
