Current and former members of Crypto Services have been involved in several projects:

* [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/) and [Constant-Time Toolkit]([https://bearssl.org/](https://github.com/pornin/CTTK)) (CTTK) were built by and are currently maintained by Thomas Pornin.
* CryptoHack ([cryptohack.org](https://cryptohack.org)), a platform with CTF-style cryptographic challenges, was co-founded by Giacomo Pope.
  It offers challenges covering all sorts of cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, lattices, zero-knowledge proofs, and more.
* The Matasano Crypto Challenges, aka [CryptoPals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com) were written by former members of the Crypto Services team.
* The [CryptoPals Guided Tour](https://www.youtube.com/@EliSohl) was created by Eli Sohl and includes screencasts covering each challenge in detail.
  The first 19 challenges are available on YouTube either [in a playlist on NCC Group's channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWvDpnCcem1P6i8pZm2x7KHp5iaxwrK_P) or on [Eli's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@EliSohl).
* The [DASP project](https://dasp.co/) and OTF or Open Crypto Audit initiatives such as the [OpenSSL audit](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2015/may/openssl-audit/) and [TrueCrypt audit](https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf).
