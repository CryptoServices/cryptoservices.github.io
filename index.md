# About Cryptography Services

Cryptographic operations tend to concentrate the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity assurances of an entire application into a very small high-value target. A specialized review of cryptographic implementation ensures that systems are designed, implemented, and operate correctly. Organizations often underestimate the need for cryptographic consulting as vulnerabilities can be obscure and poorly understood yet devastating. Systems operate seemingly correctly, but actually insecurely - a lurking risk that is taken advantage of at the worst time and in the worst way.

NCC Group's Cryptography Services practice is a specialized team of consultants focusing exclusively on the most challenging projects involving cryptographic primitives, protocols, implementations, systems, and applications. The team combines years of experience in security with a life-long passion in cryptography to provide a unique and unmatched offering.  We have a wealth of experience advising, building, breaking, fixing and deploying cryptographic solutions that our customers rely on for their core business, data protection, compliance, and security needs.

## Projects

Current and former members of Crypto Services have been involved in several projects:

* [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/) and [Constant-Time Toolkit]([https://bearssl.org/](https://github.com/pornin/CTTK)) (CTTK) were built by and are currently maintained by Thomas Pornin.
* CryptoHack ([cryptohack.org](https://cryptohack.org)), a platform with CTF-style cryptographic challenges, was co-founded by Giacomo Pope.
  It offers challenges covering all sorts of cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, lattices, zero-knowledge proofs, and more.
* The Matasano Crypto Challenges, aka [CryptoPals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com) were written by former members of the Crypto Services team.
* The [CryptoPals Guided Tour](https://www.youtube.com/@EliSohl) was created by Eli Sohl and includes screencasts covering each challenge in detail.
