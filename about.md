Cryptography Services is a practice offering of [NCC Group North America](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/), composed of consultants from NCC Group.  CS focuses exclusively on Cryptographic Security Assessments - combining years of experience in application security with a life-long passion in cryptography to provide a unique offering.  We have a wealth of experience building, breaking, fixing and deploying cryptographic solutions that our customers rely on for their core business, data protection, compliance and security needs. Our blog features a subset of the technical posts from the [NCC Group Blog](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/).  

We gave two sold out training classes at [Black Hat Vegas 2015](https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/training/beyond-the-beast-deep-dives-into-crypto-vulnerabilities.html) and [Black Hat Vegas 2016](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/training/beyond-the-beast-a-broad-survey-of-crypto-vulnerabilities.html) of our course "Beyond the BEAST: Deep Drives into Crypto Vulnerabilities".  We're continuing to offer this class, so if you're interested, please email us below to find the next offering!

You may have seen us elsewhere on the internet sponsoring the [Underhanded Crypto Contest](https://underhandedcrypto.com/rules/) and [Real World Crypto](http://www.realworldcrypto.com/rwc2017) or conducting the [TrueCrypt](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/04/truecrypt-report.html), [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/04/14/ncc-group-audit.html), and [OpenSSL](http://www.darkreading.com/openssl-to-undergo-major-audit/d/d-id/1319392) audits. This team is also the same team that developed the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) and wrote the [Tor Browser Hardening Study](https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/tree/master/reports/Tor%20Browser%20Bundle).
