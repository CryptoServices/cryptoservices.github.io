Cryptography Services is a practice offering of [NCC Group North America](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/), composed of consultants from NCC Group.  CS focuses exclusively on Cryptographic Security Assessments - combining years of experience in application security with a life-long passion in cryptography to provide a unique offering.  We have a wealth of experience building, breaking, fixing and deploying cryptographic solutions that our customers rely on for their core business, data protection, compliance and security needs. Our blog features a subset of the technical posts from the [NCC Group Blog](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/).
