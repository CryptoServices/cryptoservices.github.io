	<h2 id="vetting-protocols-and-implementations">Vetting protocols and implementations</h2>

	<p><strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong> has years of practical experience dealing with complex protocol and their implementations. In these last few years we have taken part in the open audit of <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/openssl-to-undergo-major-audit/d/d-id/1319392">OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/docker-notary/?research=Public+Reports">Docker</a>, and have worked publicly with the <em>Open Crypto Audit Project</em> (OCAP) to ensure the cryptographic correctness of projects like <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2015/february/truecrypt-phase-two-audit-announced/">Truecrypt</a>. Engagements have made us review many different protocols like <strong>QUIC</strong>, <strong>the Signal Protocol</strong>, <a href="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2016/002237.html"><strong>Olm & Megolm</strong></a>, <strong>TLS</strong> (up to version 1.3) or even the <a href="http://cryptoservices.github.io/cryptography/protocols/2016/04/27/noise-protocol.html"><strong>Noise Protocol Framework</strong></a>.</p>

	<!-- bullshit -->
	<p>Assessing cryptographic correctness is important. Implementations have to follow specifications to the letter, without diverting and taking wrong turns. <strong>High-assurance cryptography</strong> has became especially important when it comes to financial cryptography (<strong>mobile payments</strong>, <strong>high frequency trading</strong>, <strong>distributed ledgers</strong>) or privacy enhancing technologies with <strong>Tor</strong>-like networks and <strong>TLS</strong>-like protocols.</p>

	<img src="/images/about/infra.jpg" alt="infra" />

	<!-- we don't really do that, that's SIS :/ -->
	<p><strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong>' expertise covers the design and deployment of diverse type of products and infrastructures through their different phases: <strong>establishment of trust</strong>, <strong>provisioning of devices</strong>, <strong>updating schemes</strong>, <strong>public key infrastructures (PKI)</strong>, <strong>protection of data at rest</strong>...</p>

	<!-- this should not be in this category -->
	<p>We wrote the <a href="https://gist.github.com/mimoo/6dc64b287f83c7b696fbcf3523222f83">Common x509 certificate creation and validation pitfalls</a> guide and conducted the audit of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/04/14/ncc-group-audit.html">Let's Encrypt</a> as part as of the <em>Internet Security Research Group</em> initiative. We've also written the <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/tree/master/reports/Tor%20Browser%20Bundle">Tor Browser Hardening Study</a> and are maintaining a <a href="https://openvpn.fox-it.com/">hardened fork of OpenVPN</a> currently used by the Dutch Government.</p>

	<!-- bullshit -->
	<p>Our work consist of identifying <strong>threat vectors</strong> and foreseeing the boundaries of what our customers want to protect against. From man-in-the-middle (MITM) attackers able to decrypt communications to physical breaches leading to the extraction of <strong>personally identifiable information</strong> (PII), we help our clients understand the importance of a solid <strong>threat model</strong> and where cryptography resides in it. Take a look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/mimoo/79ecf4b11179379c00d548f2f79dfa89">our more detailed article</a> on threat modeling and the importance of cryptography.</p>



	<h2 id="reviewing-novel-and-advanced-cryptography">Reviewing novel and advanced cryptography</h2>

	<img src="/images/about/rwc.jpg">

	<p><strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong> stays up to date, sponsoring events like <a href="http://cryptoservices.github.io/event/2016/06/23/real-world-crypto-2017.html">Real World Crypto</a> or the <a href="https://underhandedcrypto.com/2016/01/27/rules-for-the-2016-underhanded-crypto-contest/">Underhanded Crypto Contest</a>, and sending its members to the different conferences the field has to offer. With this continual quest of acquiring knowledge, <strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong> has obtained experience in numerous area of advanced cryptography. The security of <strong>distributed ledgers</strong>, <strong>smart contracts</strong>, <strong>the blockchain</strong> (check our recent <a href="https://z.cash/zh/blog/auditing-zcash.html">audit of Zcash</a>), <strong>whitebox cryptography</strong>, <strong>light-weight cryptography</strong>, <strong>database encryption</strong> and even <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/our-research/post-quantum-cryptography-overview/">post-quantum cryptography</a> are examples of advanced concepts we are knowledgeable in.</p>


	<h2 id="identifying-weaknesses-in-cryptosystems">Identifying weaknesses in cryptosystems</h2>

	<img src="/images/about/code.jpg">
	
	<p>One part of <strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong>' goal is to find what can go wrong in our customers' cryptosystems. We have published research on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/563.pdf">block ciphers cryptanalysis</a> last year, as well as <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/644.pdf">potential backdoors in Diffie-Hellman</a> earlier this year.</p>

	<p>These failures expand beyond the paper, notably in <strong>side-channel attacks</strong>. Check out our whitepaper on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/839.pdf">timing attacks against ECDSA</a>. From RSA's blinding techniques to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbqNCgVcXsM">Differential Power Analysis</a>, we've got it covered.</p>

	<p>We're also the people behind the <a href="http://cryptopals.com/">CryptoPals</a> and the <a href="https://microcorruption.com/login">MicroCorruption</a> <strong>online challenges</strong> that you might have heard of!</p>

	<h2 id="sharing-the-knowledge">Sharing the knowledge</h2>

	<img src="/images/about/Class.jpg">
	
	<p>We gave two sold out <strong>training classes</strong> at <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/training/beyond-the-beast-deep-dives-into-crypto-vulnerabilities.html">Black Hat Vegas 2015</a> and <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/training/beyond-the-beast-a-broad-survey-of-crypto-vulnerabilities.html">Black Hat Vegas 2016</a> of our course “<em>Beyond the BEAST: Deep Drives into Crypto Vulnerabilities</em>”. We’re continuing to offer this class, so if you’re interested, please <a href="mailto:CryptographyServices@nccgroup.com">contact us</a>!</p>

	One of the goal of <strong class="cs">Cryptography Services</strong> is to <strong>disseminate knowledge</strong> inside and outside the company. Our team publish <a href="http://cryptoservices.github.io/cryptographic/attacks/2016/09/03/Sweet32.html">videos</a>, <a href="/blog">blogposts</a>, whitepapers and share research results in various conferences across the world.</p>
