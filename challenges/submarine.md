**Hi you**!

This is the second challenge of [the CryptoServices internship thingy](http://cryptoservices.github.io/jobs/)

![submarine](/images/challenges/submarine.jpg)

This is the token used by the user named *qwerty* to log-in into **a very secretive submarine**:

`6obi67W57jYVxJyh3vyTp7l31dHghJSWP117i+wqTa4=`

Can you find what token would allow you to log-in as the user *david*?

[Check this gist](https://gist.github.com/mimoo/8d8c02b9fe299f0ed10bff63092052e8). The file `submarine.py` is the code used to create and parse tokens. I hope it helps!

If you can forge a token to log-in as david, can you send it to me? I really need to get in that submarine...
