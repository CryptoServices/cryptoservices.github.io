**Hello you**!

If you haven't heard, [we're looking for a summer 2017 intern](http://cryptoservices.github.io/jobs/).

Our job at Cryptography Services is mostly **a series of challenges** and **brainstorming sessions**.

That is why we came up with this small list of problems for you to bang your head on. It was not made to scare you away nor be *too* time-consuming. Anyway, here they are:

1. [A Plate of French Fries](/challenges/french_fries) 🍟

2. [A Very Secretive Submarine](/challenges/submarine) 🌊 

3. [An Airplane Screen App](/challenges/screenapp) 🛩

If you can finish these 3 challenges, you should probably [send us an email](mailto:david.wong@nccgroup.trust?subject=challenges done!) with the answers along with your resume ;)
