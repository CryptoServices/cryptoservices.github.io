## Summer Internship

![internship](/images/jobs/internship.jpg)

The **Cryptography Services** team of [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/) is looking for a **summer 2017 intern**!

We are looking for you if you're into **cryptography** and **security**! The internship would allow you to follow consultants on the job as well as lead your own research project.

Who are we? We are **consultants**! Big companies come to us and ask us to hack their stuff (legally), review their code and advise on their design. If we're not doing that, we spend our time [reading papers](http://cryptoservices.github.io/quantum/2015/12/04/one-time-signatures.html), [researching](http://cryptoservices.github.io/event/2016/06/27/how-to-backdoor-diffie-hellman.html), [attending conferences](http://cryptoservices.github.io/event/2016/06/23/real-world-crypto-2017.html), [giving talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33RbRid1deo) and [teaching classes](http://cryptoservices.github.io/cryptography/training/2016/02/12/crypto-course-comes-back-to-black-hat.html), ... whatever floats our boat. Not one week is like the other! If you've spent some time doing [cryptopals challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) you will probably like what we are doing.

We can't say much about who are the clients we work for, except for the public audits we sometimes do. For example we've performed public audits for [TrueCrypt](https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf), [OpenSSL](http://www.darkreading.com/openssl-to-undergo-major-audit/d/d-id/1319392), [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/04/14/ncc-group-audit.html), [Docker]() and more recently [Zcash](https://z.cash/zh/blog/auditing-zcash.html).

I was myself [the first intern](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/199/my-internship-at-cryptography-services-in-chicago/) of Cryptography Services and I'd be happy to answer any question you might have =)
